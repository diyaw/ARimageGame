- by default ARcore focus is set to one meter we have to change it to auto-focus.
-  To do so, use the Config.FocusMode.AUTO parameter in the session configuration.
- Created PhysicsController class to manage all physics related functions. Internally, it uses [JBullet physics](http://jbullet.advel.cz/) engine.
